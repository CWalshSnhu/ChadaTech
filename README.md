### 1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This project's purpose was to create two types of clocks: a 12 hour and a 24 hour clock that displays in an app. It has a menu so that the user can add an hour, minute, or second to the clock.
This was done by creating a class, and creating two instances of clocks.

### 2. What did you do particularly well?

I have done the Clock class well, in terms of object oriented programming. It works well for the project, however usually I would have put it as a different file to have it be more abstract.

### 3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

In this project, I could have inhanced the input validation more, because if the user enters something other than a number, the app glitches out. However, I have learned about this since then, and was able to acheive it in the third project.

### 4. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

For me, the most challenging part was figuring out how C++ classes work with the header files. It still is a little confusing to me since uploading this, but I have done more research about it online so I can see how it works. But the concept behind it is a little murky for me.

### 5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

The skills gained from this project is core for programming in C++ I feel, although simple it is very important to learn about input validation, loops, private vs. public members and methods, and classes. I will be able to transfer everything I have learned with C++ and Java into the gaming industry.

### 6. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I made this program very maintainable with adding in-line comments into the main C++ file, so that anyone who opens and reviews the code will be able to see how everything works and connects to each other. Without in-line comments, code can become very confusing to others and yourself.
